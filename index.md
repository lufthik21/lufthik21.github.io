**Hotel Recsys:** Make a new approach to enhance hotel recommendations using a wide and deep learning network model to strike the right balance between memorization and generalization. With such a vast and varied user base, we acknowledged the fact that a one-size-fits-all solution would not have worked to cater to the varying demand and supply. There was a need to provide our users with a more personalized experience on the hotel search page.

<div style="text-align: justify">The purpose of this project is to optimize the neural network model hyper-parameters to estimate facies class from well logs.
In machine learning, model parameters can be divided into two main categories:
1. Trainable parameters: such as weights in neural networks learned by training algorithms and the user does not interfere in the process,
2. Hyper-parameters that user can set before training operation such as learning rate or the number of dense layers in the model.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">First I build the EDA of the data. Then, to identify interesting combinations that occur more than by chance, I calculate the parameters that will be used in the prediction. Lastly, I modeled and evaluated the model I made to test my hypothesis.</div>
